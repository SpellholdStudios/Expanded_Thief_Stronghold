## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod expands the thief stronghold to make it more interesting by adding new quests and importing Narlen Darkwalk and Black Lilly from the Baldur's Gate Shadow Thieves guild into Athkatla.

<details><summary><ins>Original note from Gebhard Blucher</ins></summary>
<p>

###### I've heard quite a few people complaining about the Thief Stronghold in BG2: some said that it is either dull, too short, annoying, or all three. Well, I like it. Along with the Mage Stronghold, it's my favorite stronghold in the game. I do agree however, that it could use some spicing up.

###### That's where this mod comes in - it expands quite a bit on the original stronghold, fixes some existing bugs and has a lot of (I hope) cute touches.
</p>
</details><br>

**Note:** This mod that was first released at <a href="http://blucher.fortunecity.com/bgstuff/bgstuff.html">Gebhard Blucher's web page</a>. As this site is no more available since many years, it was time to save it from disappearance. It is now hosted at Spellhold Studios with Gebhard Blucher's authorization.

##

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __`setup-gbthfkp.exe`__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __gbthfkp__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old save games. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Expanded Thief Stronghold for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: gbthfkp folder and a setup-gbthfkp.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-gbthfkp.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-gbthfkp.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS

Expanded Thief Stronghold for Mac OS is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: gbthfkp folder, setup-gbthfkp and setup-gbthfkp.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-gbthfkp.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-gbthfkp.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Expanded Thief Stronghold for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **`cd`** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-gbthfkp`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-gbthfkp --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## 

##### Version 2.14 &nbsp;(July 28, 2006)

- If you want the old "*Improved Mae'Var*" component, it can be found in the /_debug/impmaevar.rar archive; just extract the files into the override.
- Also, added a few banters, and tweaked (reduced) the environnemental chat in the tavern front of the guild. Some other minor changes.

## 

##### Version 2.13 &nbsp;(July 26, 2006): Some significant changes.

- After much deliberation and some discussion, I've decided to remove the "*Improved Mae'Var*" component of the mod completely. If you want him, it is still out there in Westly Weimer's Tactics mod (in pretty much the same form as when I sent him off to Wes). Increasing the difficulty of the game is not part of this mod.
- Another change is that you may now enter the Dock Barracks before the assault on the guild house. I had originally cut that area off until the assault to prevent some possible exploits, but I've decided that it doesn't matter. Besides, as SixOfSpades told me, it's nice to go in there and talk to the guards when you aren't on the quest. This mod is about expanding the content of the game, not removing access to content (no matter how thin that content may be).
- The storefront is now a proper tavern, a real "front" for the illegal activities within. Rattell now has drinks for sale (I highly recommend tasting the Old Winyards wine, myself), and there are a few patrons inside getting drunk, as well as saucy tavern wench! Brannel (the guard who used to be outside the guild) is now located inside. He serves as a bouncer keeping people out of the back rooms.
- Every half a ten-day the chance that your thieves will be arrested is recalculated, based on the difficulty of the tasks assigned to them. Previously I had carried over a scripting (quirk? error? inconsistency?) made by Bioware that allowed thieves to operate with impunity, no matter how outrageous your demands, as long as you didn't change their activities. Now there is always a chance each week that your thieves will be caught by the law, unless you assign them to be inactive (in which case they are doing nothing but cooling their heels, and so risk no chance of getting arrested).
- On a more technical note, I've made further changes to the .tp2 and other files in the mod package. Most changes were made with an eye to improving "friendliness" with other mods. (Though *some* small amount of destructive patching remains in place in regards to the few NPCs and areas comprising the stronghold experience. This is a conscious decision on my part, as obviously changes within the guild are quite extensive and many are vital to the proper functioning of this mod.) However, unless you install another mod making changes to the actual guild and its NPCs, there should be no problems. (Note that this only makes sense as two mods trying to do similar things logically won't work together despite the virtues of WeiDU without some coordination between the mod makers.)
- Also I've cleaned up quite a few of the .tra and .d files to make them easier to read, and the changes to them more apparent. Lastly this version has the usual tweaks and buglet fixes, etc., etc.

## 

##### Version 2.12

- Fixed a dumb .tp2 file mistake. Doh!

## 

##### Version 2.11 &nbsp;(July 23, 2006)

- Tweaked the stores, added some new dialogue.
- Extensive mod and .tp2 file optimization.
- In this version you must be a thief to get the guild. I didn't like the way I patched Renal's dialogue previously. So if you still want the guild and your character isn't a thief, you will have to use the NotThief custom PC script in the GBThfKp/_debug directory (at least for now).
- Mae'var and his goons will not attempt to move toward invisible characters if they can no longer see anyone. Feel free to cheese them for an easy win, if you are into that sort of thing.

##### Version 2.10 &nbsp;(July 21, 2006)

- Fixed a compatibility issue with the Amber mod (tested).
- Also this may clear up any issues the mod may have had with later versions of TTD (untested).
- Some associated tweaks that I doubt anyone but myself would notice.

## 

##### Version 2.9 &nbsp;(July 20, 2006)

- Disabled the "*Random Encounters*" and the "*Remove Improved Mae'Var*" components. The random encounters may return, but right now I find them to be too annoyingly frequent. As for Mae'var, I like his "improveness" and feel the component to remove him is unneeded.
- Also some minor tweakage and buglet fixes:
  - Fixed a problem with the area outside of the orc being flagged as a random encounter (no save) area.
  - Tweaked a few lines of dialogue.
  - Removed some extra gem, etc. bags from the stronghold.
  - Fixed the infamous "noblewoman 4" buglet.
  - A few other, very minor, changes.

## 

##### Version 2.8

- Fixed a minor translation error (missing string with the new '*remove improved Mae'Var*' component. Thanks again Dyara! (I translated the Spanish entry myself, and it probably shows. :-)

## 

##### Version 2.7

- New install-time option to disable the '*Improved Mae'Var*' component of this mod.

## 

##### Version 2.6

- Fixed minor compatibility issue with the Kelsey mod.
- Made note that Renal will offer the guild to any class, not just thieves.
- Very minor and long over-due fixes to this file. It's still ugly though.

## 

##### Version 2.5

- Bug fixes (thanks Dyara and Sherman Wang).
- Added Spanish translation (thanks Dufroise and Immortality of Clan DLAN).

## 

##### Version 2.4 &nbsp;(July 1, 2002)

- Minor changes, removed scripts (they're on my site if you want them).

## 

##### Version 2.3

- German translation. Wow! Thanks a lot Dyara!
- Fixed the readme.
- Included the 'notthief' script.

## 

##### Version 2.2

##### Version 2.1

## 

##### Version 2.0

##
